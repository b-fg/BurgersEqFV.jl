## 1. Introduction to Julia

Julia is a programming language with the following properties

- **Compiled** via LLVM (fast!)
- **Just in time** (JIT) compilation
- **Functional language**: ecnouraging function evaluation, composability, functions as objects
- **Multiple dispatch**: function calls based on argument types
- **Dynamically typed**: variables can change during runtime
- **Metaprogramming**: powerful macros to generate (and avoid repeating) code
- **Interoperability** with C, Python, R, and Fortran libraries
- **Easy syntax**, similar to Python or Matlab
- **Package manager** that works for real (unlike Python...)
- **Open source** with a growing ecosystem

## 2. The 1D viscous Burgers' equation
The [viscous Burgers' equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers%27_equation) is a 1D PDE of the form

$\partial_t u + \partial_x f = 0$

with convection and diffusion fluxes

$f = u^2/2 - \nu\partial_xu$

where ``\nu`` is the diffusion coefficient (aka. viscosity). The PDE is defined in a 1D periodic domain of $x\in[0,2\pi]$. A random initial condition for $u$ will be considered (more details in [Initial and boundary conditions](#Initial-and-boundary-conditions))

Because of the nonlinear term and the interplay with viscous effects, this PDE naturally distributes energy across a wide range of scales until it dissipates at the smallest scales. This resembles how *turbulence* behaves in fluid flows. so it is a good simple PDE to study numerical methods and turbulence models. The wave-propagating behaviour of the nonlinear term also gives rise to discontinuities, mimicking shock-wave phenomena of compressible flows.

# ╔═╡ 44d5b669-03f9-43b7-8248-6b4cfc2f8985
md"### Finite volume method

To discretize this PDE in space, we will resort to the FVM. Our basic assumption is that the continuous solution ``u(x,t)`` can be discretize in space into multiple cells. The solution at each cell ``i`` is a volume-average (or line for 1D) value

$u_i(x,t)=\dfrac{1}{\delta x}\int^{x_{i+1/2}}_{x_{i-1/2}}u(x,t)\mathrm{d}x$

where ``\delta x=(x_{i+1/2}-x_{i-1/2})`` is the cell volume.

The piecewise-constant values create discontinuities of the solution at the cells interface.  
"

# ╔═╡ b022fe41-000e-440a-9ef9-28697fdb6d72
md"
The FVM takes advantage of the Gauss theorem, where the integral form of the PDE can be transformed from the divergence of the flux into a summation of the flux across the faces of a cell

$\dfrac{1}{\delta x}\int_{V}\partial_x f \mathrm{d}V = \dfrac{1}{\delta x}\int_{S} f\cdot\hat{n}\mathrm{d}S$

Thus, we can express our PDE in semi-discrete form as

$\dfrac{\mathrm{d}u_i}{\mathrm{d}t}=-\dfrac{f_{i+1/2}-f_{i-1/2}}{\delta x}$

md"#### Numerical flux

**Convective flux**

Our next job is to define the intercell flux, aka. numerical flux, and a time-intergrator method. First, we focus on the convective flux $f_c=u^2/2$. Instead of using the piece-wise constant values at the $_{i+1/2}$ face, $u_i$ and $u_{i+1}$, we will reconstruct a higher-order solution using the [$k$-scheme by Van Leer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSCL_scheme#Piecewise_parabolic_reconstruction), a high-order generalization of the [MUSCL scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSCL_scheme), both for the left side of the face, $u^L_{i+1/2}$ and the right, $u^R_{i+1/2}$ (which is written symmetrically)

$u^L_{i+1/2} = u_i + \dfrac{1}{4}\left[(1-k)(u_i-u_{i-1}) + (1+k)(u_{i+1}-u_i)\right]$
$u^R_{i+1/2} = u_{i+1} + \dfrac{1}{4}\left[(1-k)(u_{i+1}-u_{i+2}) + (1+k)(u_{i}-u_{i+1})\right]$

The $k$-scheme provides a tunable parameter, $k$, which can result in the following reconsuctrions:

-  $$k=-1$$: Upwind 2nd-order
-  $$k=0$$: Fromm
-  $$k=1/3$$: ? 3rd-order
-  $$k=1/2$$: Quick 3rd-order
-  $$k=1$$: Central 2nd-order

Note that the scheme goes from being fully upwind (-1) to fully central (1). Values of $k<-1$ and $k>1$ are allowed, and they bias the reconstruction even more to the upwind and downwind directions, respectively."

# ╔═╡ 02e1a59c-c747-4bf0-93a8-074ea7f88f9b
md"Next, after computing $u_L$ and $u_R$, we need to define how the intercell flux will be computed. Note that this numerical flux is unique to each face! That is $f_{i+1/2} = -f_{(i+1)-1/2}$.

We choose the [Rusanov flux](link) to solve the Riemann problem at the face (two states at the same location)

$f_{i+1/2}(u_L,u_R) = \dfrac{1}{2}(f(u_L) + f(u_R)) - \dfrac{1}{2}\max{(|u_L|, |u_R|)}(u_R-u_L)$

Let's define the function for computing the convective flux using the Rusanov scheme

**Viscous flux**

The computation of viscous (aka. diffusive, aka. dissipative...) fluxes is more straightforward. Importantly, this flux contains the gradient $\partial_x u$. In the current grid configuration, gradient of cell-centered quantities, such as $u_i$, live in the cell faces, and that is great because we do not need to solve a two-point value problem, differently from the convective flux. Then, the divergence of the gradient, living in the face, already provides the unique viscous flux at that face.

Let's break it down. First, we compute the discrete gradient using central differences, for example at the $i+1/2$ face

$\nu\partial_x u|_{i+1/2} \approx \nu\dfrac{u_{i+1} - u_i}{\delta x}$

And then, using the divergence theorem again, we get the dissipative flux across the cell boundaries 

$\partial_x (\nu \partial_x u) \approx \dfrac{\nu\partial_x u|_{i+1/2} - \nu\partial_x u|_{i-1/2}}{\delta x} = \dfrac{\nu\dfrac{u_{i+1} - u_i}{\delta x} - \nu\dfrac{u_{i} - u_{i-1}}{\delta x}}{\delta x}=\nu\dfrac{u_{i+1}-2u_i+u_{i-1}}{\delta x^2}$

Let's write the dissipative flux function

Adding the convective flux (`f_conv`) and the dissipative flux (`f_diss`) will provide us with the full RHS of the original PDE. As noted, the only variables needed are the discrete solution $u_i$, viscosity $\nu$, cell size $δx$, and $k$ value for the face-reconstruction scheme. In functional form"

Here we used a few syntax conventions and helpers here:
- `u` is a 1D array (`Vector`) storing the solution, and `fK` is the vector storing the numerical flux at the face. Since we have a periodic domain, `length(u)==length(fK)`
- `rhs` is the vector storing the RHS values, and we have named the function `dudt!` indicating with `!` that the content of `rhs` is going to be modified in this function
- `@views` provide a view into a specific slice of an array without allocating new memory. For example, `ui[i+1] == up[i]`, and `ui[i+1] - ui[i]` becomes just `up[i] - ui[i]`
- This allows to use broadcasting more efficiently. The `@.` syntax indicates that a macro called `@.` will expand every operator in that line of code from a scalar to a vector operation, that is$br `@. fK = f_conv(um, ui, up, upp, k) - f_diss(um, ui, up, ν, dx)` $br becomes $br `fK .= f_conv.(um, ui, up, upp, k) .- f_diss.(um, ui, up, ν, dx)` $br so we do not need to write all the dots in this way (the macro will generate it for us before compilation).

We will use the CFL condition to predict a stable time step dynamically. We need to account for convective and diffusive conditions, and pick the most restrictive one

$\mathrm{CFL}_c = \delta t_c \dfrac{\max |u_i|}{\delta x}$

The problem needs to be closed with an initial condition (IC) and boundary conditions (BC).

#### Boundary conditions

BCs are set as periodic. In our discretized spatial domain this means that $f_{N+1/2} := f_{1-1/2}$, and the solution $u_{N+1}:=u_N$. In Julia, we can use the package [`CircularArrays`](https://github.com/Vexatos/CircularArrays.jl) which automatically provides this periodic behaviour when looping through any array (also multidimensional).

md"#### Initial condition

Instead of considering the initial condition for $u_i$, we set an initial condition for the **energy spectrum** of $u_i$. That is, we set an analytical function for $\hat{E}(\kappa)$, ie. the energy content of $u_i$ in Fourier space ($\kappa$). The analytical function for $\hat{E}(\kappa)$ is

$\hat{E}(\kappa) = A^4\kappa^4e^{-(\kappa/\kappa_0)^2}$

where $A$ is a constant set as $A=2k_0^{-5}/(3\sqrt{\pi})$ so that $\int_0^\infty\hat{E}(\kappa)\mathrm{d}\kappa=1/2$. Here $\kappa_0$ is the wavenumber at which we want the energy to peak, and we select $\kappa_0=10$.

The mode amplitude of the initial condition at each wavenumber is $|\hat{u}(\kappa)|=\sqrt{2\hat{E}(\kappa)}$ (ie. the amplitude of harmonic functions of course). So we find each mode amplitude and frequency with

$\hat{u}(\kappa)=\sqrt{2\hat{E}(\kappa)}e^{i2\pi R(\kappa)}$

where $e^{i2\pi R(\kappa)}$ sets a random phase $(0,2\pi)$ for each wavenumber through the random uniform sampler $R(\kappa)\in[0,1]$.

Finally, we need to transform back our initial condition from Fourier space, $\hat{u}_i(\kappa,0)$ to physical space $u_i(x,0)$ using the inverse Fast Fourier Transfrom (FFT).
